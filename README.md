# Phonebook (FSO exercise)

This repository contains a simple full stack phonebook application for an exercise from Full Stack Open.

Website live at [Render](https://phonebook-ka5o.onrender.com) and the API [here](http://phonebook-ka5o.onrender.com).

To run locally, execute `npm i && npm start` script in the command line. The application binds on port 3001 by default; provide custom one through `PORT=[custom port] npm start`.

To test if the server is running, execute `curl http://localhost:3001/info`
